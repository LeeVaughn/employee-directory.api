# Employee Directory API

Uses the Random User Generator API to create an employee directory for Awesome Startup based on PNG mockups.

## Motivation

This project was created as a part of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program.

## Features

* Requests a JSON object from the Random User Generator API
* Parses that data to display 12 random employees from the list
* Information displayed includes thumbnail image, full name, email address, and location
* Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as username, date of birth, and address
* User can move through the different modal windows using prev and next buttons
* User can search for specific employees by either name or username

## Future Improvements

* Restrict modal windows after search to only those employees who match the search term

## Build With
