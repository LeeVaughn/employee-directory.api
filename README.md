# Employee Directory API (Work in Progress)

Uses the Random User Generator API to create an employee directory for Awesome Startup.

## Motivation

This project was created as a part of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program.

## Features

* Requests a JSON object from the Random User Generator API
* Parses that data to display 12 random employees from the list
* Information displayed includes thumbnail image, full name, email address, and location
* Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as date of birth and address

## Future Improvements

* TBD
